# WhatsApp-Bot-for-Live-Cricket-Updates

Built a WhatsApp Bot using Python and Twilio Framework which takes a Team Name as a input, when user sends a message to the Twilio Number
(+ (415) 15238886) on WhatsApp. The team name is passed as an input in the Python Function which makes an API Request to fetch the 
latest score of the team, the JSON response is then parsed and provided to the user in the WhatsApp message window.

The service is hosted on a Flask Server using ngrok.
